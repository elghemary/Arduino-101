## Setup
Explain the setup in detail. This can be step by step instructions to assemble the hardware. Include any necessary warnings or things to be careful about.

## What I Learned
Explain what you learned from this project. This could be about how certain components work, how to debug hardware or software issues, or broader concepts.

## Challenges
Discuss any challenges you faced during the project. How did you overcome them? This can be a great place for reflection and demonstrating problem-solving skills.

## Further Improvements
If there are any potential improvements, extensions, or modifications you could make to the project, discuss them here. It's okay if you don't have anything in mind right away, you can always come back and update this section later.

## Resources
Include links to any resources you found particularly helpful or informative for this project. This could be tutorial videos, articles, forum threads, etc.

## Pictures/Videos
Include any pictures or videos of the project. Pictures of the setup can be particularly helpful for others looking to replicate your project, and videos can provide a dynamic look at how the project works in real-time.

## Acknowledgements
If you want, you can acknowledge people who helped you, the book you're using, online resources, or anything else that aided you in your project.
